    About me
  </h3>
  <styled.div>
    I started developing around 1996 when I maintained my very first website on
    <styled.a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities"
    >
      Geocities
    </styled.a>
    . A few years later, I had a weblog. Believe me, it was an exciting time when there were less than 100 weblogs in Germany and
     
    <styled.a
      className="highlight-link"
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type"
    >
      Movable Type
    </styled.a>
     
    was the state of the art.

    After school, I started studying computer science at the university and after graduating, I worked as a research assistant in computer science education. I wrote my Ph.D. thesis about misconceptions in computer science.

    My excitement for web technologies hasn't changed since the early years - I am more and more excited about the fast developing technologies and tools. I have experience with several JavaScript frameworks, especially with React. React has a simple but great API, which provides a lot of flexibility and there is so much awesome stuff you can do with it. By the way, this website was built with
     
    <styled.a
      className="highlight-link"
      href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/"
    >
      Gatsby.js
    </styled.a>
    , which is a static site generator for React.
