Top 10 reasons why using mailing lists for discussions is a bad idea

1. Moderating content
It's not possible to moderate threads and messages. Of course, mailing lists usually have moderation options - doing the moderator job on a busy mailing-list with lively discussions is a full-time job though and therefore not practical.

2. Referencing messages
Mailing lists archives often provide links to individual messages today. However, these links are usually not very human-readable, hard to predict 

3. "All", "Nothing" or "Digest"
Maling lists have a limited choice of notifications. It's usually a choice between "all", "nothing" and a digest. When you want to filter by topics, you have to use email filters and even then, it's very likely that you will miss 

4. Finding threads


5. Keeping track of participants
Everyone who has been using mailing lists actively knows these situations when you suddenly realize that someone who was supposed to read the current discussion was removed from the list of receipients or, even worse, someone who shouldn't read the discussion was added.

6. Everyone has the power to destroy a discussion
Simular to 5., a single mistake by one user can infect the whole discussion. I have seen funny things like a subject being translated to the native language of a user and then spread by the people replying to this message.

7. Changing history is not possible

8. Making posts more important

9. Posting styles

Posting styles are different. In-line, top, bottom or mixed - there are so many options. I learned about posting styles in the Usenet, where top- and bottom-posting (with a full quote) was often considered as bad style, so I pretty much always used in-line style. After being on a large maling-lists for a few days, I immediately dropped this habit. Inline-posting in connection with top- or bottom-posting makes discussions pretty much unreadable.
