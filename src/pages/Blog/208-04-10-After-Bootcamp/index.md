I myself have graduated from a coding bootcamp and found a job soon after. It would be wrong to compare this to other graduates as I already had a background in computer science, but I think I learned a lot both from applying and also from talking to other graduates.

## Present yourself

Most coding bootcamp graduates have probably already learned how important it is to present themselves.

### Beautifying your GitHub repositories

**Write helpful READMEs**

A good README should have at least a description of what the project does, the techstack, some images (GIFs demos are awesome) and short install instructions.

**Don't bore your readers with obvious information**

You should assume that anyone who is interested in your projects has a basic knowledge of the topic. If you used React, you do not need to explain what React is. Also, don't explain basic command line commands. Using 3 sentences to explain what 'cd' does (yes, I have seen this) will rather make you look like an idiot instead of a good documentation writer

**Go through your code and add comments**

Working on projects is often stresful and you many developers tend to making things work first instead of spending time on comments. Therefore, you should go through the main parts of your repositories and add comments to explain your code.

Comments are supposed to make your code easier to understand. But it's important to understand that writing comments does not necessarily make your code easier. Take a look at this example:

```javascript
// this function returns the sum of a and b
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Yes, it's a very simplified examples and might not be realistic. It still shows that code can also just be redundant information.

**Use a .gitignore file**

I have seen so many portfolio repositories which did not use a .gitignore file but shared API tokens, secrets, passwords or a complete node_modules folder.

## Work on your knowledge

Reading job description is often a frustrating experience and lets you feel dumb right after being proud how much you learned in the last months. But wait... is it even realistic that there are junior developers who are experts in JavaScript and PHP and know how to use all the frameworks and libraries? Well, probably not. But what happens if they just ask you questions about the things you don't know?

I heard from many bootcamp graduates that they started learning other languages right after graduating because they thought they would need them for getting a job. While this idea is not completely wrong, I think it's not helpful to do this immediately after graduating.

I also found it extremely helpful to watch beginner tutorials about topics which I was already familiar with. That might sound like a waste of time, but

## Learn to talk about your knowledge

Aristoteles: _Those that know, do. Those that understand, teach._

This quote might be a bit over the top, but it summarizes pretty well that just

## Keep your knowledge up to date
